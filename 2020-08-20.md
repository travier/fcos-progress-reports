  - Added Wireguard to the base OS. Documentation [in
    progress](https://github.com/coreos/fedora-coreos-docs/pull/150)
  - Split out our PXE initramfs and rootfs into separate artifacts:
    [#390](https://github.com/coreos/fedora-coreos-tracker/issues/390)
  - ISO artifacts now embed exact initramfs/rootfs used for PXE:
    [coreos-assembler#1643](https://github.com/coreos/coreos-assembler/pull/1643)
  - `coreos-installer` now has `--save-partlabel` and `--save-partindex`
    options to preserve specified partitions:

    [Zincati](https://coreos.github.io/zincati/)
