  - Presented Fedora CoreOS [overview and
    demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErF_0xQmxrU) to public
  - Improved [Download and Release
    page](https://getfedora.org/en/coreos) on the Fedora Website.
      - shows package information and differences between releases
      - shows stream information at the top
      - shows Vultr download artifacts and GCP image information
  - Switched FCOS to use persistent NIC naming (i.e., ens2 vs eth0)
  - FCOS no longer brings up networking in the initramfs on Ignition
    boot if not needed. This is helpful for environments with no
    networking or complex networking setups.

      - support for fetching Ignition configs over HTTP(S)
      - lots of s390x enablement work
      - support for modifying kernel arguments at install-time
  - Ignition 2.4.0 release
      - conditional networking support
      - support for creating LUKS devices; this will be used in the
        future to support encrypted root devices
      - Support for gs:// URLS (similar to existing support for s3://
        URLS)
      - CA bundle support
  - Afterburn 4.4.1 and 4.4.2 releases
