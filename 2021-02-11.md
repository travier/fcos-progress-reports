# 2021-02-11

  - Boot disk mirroring (RAID 1) support is complete
  - `/boot` is now mounted read-only, and `/boot/efi` is no longer mounted by
    default
      - Kernel argument changes are managed via `rpm-ostree kargs`.
      - Bootloader updates are managed by bootupd.
      - There's no longer a canonical EFI System Partition; each boot disk in a
        mirrored set has its own copy. bootupd will handle updating bootloader
        binaries on each EFI partition.
  - New rpm-ostree release
    [v2021.1](https://github.com/coreos/rpm-ostree/releases/tag/v2021.1)
      - The `rpm-ostree livefs` command is now called `live-apply` and is now
        much safer to use.
      - rpm-ostree now ships a DNF Count Me compatible timer and systemd unit,
        though they're still disabled for the time being.
  - Performed an async release for the sudo CVE on all three production
    streams. Thankfully, the kernel CVE lined up with a scheduled release.
  - Had virtual face-to-face meetings about [growing the FCOS
    community](https://github.com/coreos/fedora-coreos-tracker/blob/master/docs/20210204_growing_fcos_community.md)
    and [FCOS as an
    edition](https://github.com/coreos/fedora-coreos-tracker/blob/master/docs/20210204_fcos_official_edition.md)
  - FCOS now uses the sqlite rpmdb backend
